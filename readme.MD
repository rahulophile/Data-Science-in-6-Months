# Data Science in 6 Months — Public Journey 🚀

This GitHub repository documents my complete, day-by-day 6‑month Data Science journey — starting from the basics and aiming to reach at least an entry-level data science role. It’s public so anyone who wants to learn Data Science in 6 months can follow the same path and build a solid foundation.

## Why This Repo?
- **From Zero to Job-Ready:** A beginner-friendly, structured roadmap.
- **Daily Learning Logs:** Every day’s effort, notes, and practice captured.
- **Transparent + Reproducible:** Open, step-by-step progress you can replicate.

## Repository Structure
- **6 Months → 6 Folders:** One folder per month.
- **Daily Breakdown:** Each month contains daily folders with notes, code, resources, and tasks.

Example structure:
- [1st-Month/](1st-Month/)
	- [Day-1/Day-1.md](1st-Month/Day-1/Day-1.md)

More month folders (2nd-Month, 3rd-Month, ... 6th-Month) will be added as the journey progresses.

## How to Use
- **Follow Month by Month:** Start with Month 1 and complete daily folders in order.
- **Replicate the Process:** Run the same tasks and notebooks; customize as needed.
- **Track Your Progress:** Use daily reflections and TODOs to measure growth.

## 6‑Month Roadmap (High-Level)
- **Month 1 — Foundations:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Data Cleaning, EDA, Git basics.
- **Month 2 — Statistics + Visualization:** Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly, storytelling.
- **Month 3 — Machine Learning I:** Supervised learning (Linear/Logistic Regression, Trees), model evaluation.
- **Month 4 — Machine Learning II:** Ensembles, feature engineering, cross-validation, pipelines.
- **Month 5 — Real Projects:** End-to-end DS projects, basic deployment (Streamlit/FastAPI), documentation.
- **Month 6 — Jobs + Portfolio:** Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub polish, interview prep, case studies, mock projects.

## Daily Folder Template
Each `Day-X/` folder typically includes:
- Objectives: What you’ll learn today.
- Notes: Concepts, formulas, screenshots, references.
- Code: Notebooks/scripts for practice.
- Mini-Task: Small assignments to cement learning.
- Reflection: What you learned; plan for tomorrow.

## Tools & Setup
- Python 3.10+ (Anaconda or `venv`)
- Jupyter or VS Code
- Core libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Plotly
- Optional: Streamlit, FastAPI, DVC, Docker (for deployment later)

## Contribute / Follow Along
- **Fork + Star:** Create your copy and track progress.
- **Issues/PRs:** Open issues for suggestions or fixes.
- **Learning Partners:** If you’re doing the 6‑month challenge, reach out — collaboration welcome.
